SINGAPORE – In an attempt to evade arrest, a doctor who drove a car after drinking beer tried to change seats with his passenger when he spotted a police roadblock.

The passenger refused to do so and Nah Kwang Meng, who practises at Dr Nah & Lee Family Clinic in Woodlands, initially failed a breathalyser test after he stepped out of the vehicle.

He was later found to have 32 micrograms (mcg) of alcohol in 100ml of breath – below the prescribed legal limit of 35mcg.

Even though he had not been drink driving, Nah, 41, was fined $4,000 on Friday after he pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to perform an act that could pervert the course of justice.

Assistant Public Prosecutor Chye Jer Yuan told the court that before going behind the wheel on July 14, 2022, Nah had dinner and consumed about three to four glasses of beer.

He was driving along Sophia Road towards Upper Wilkie Road shortly before 11.30pm when he spotted a police roadblock.

The prosecutor said: “The accused requested his front-seat passenger to swop seats with him, so that he would not be presented as the driver of the vehicle at the roadblock.
